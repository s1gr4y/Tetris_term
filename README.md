Play tetris in the terminal!

No Dependencies needed! Just a standard c++ compiler.

# Build

Build with the bat file. A linux build supposedly works by runing the shell script.\
Still have not tested portability of linux builds since no -static flag.

# Bugs/Notes

Windows 11 and Ubuntu show proper output for the terminal.
Windows 10 is a bit buggy.
